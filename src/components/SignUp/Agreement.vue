<p>13.<br/>
<p>No Warranties.</p>
<p>13.1<br/>
No Warranties. THE PROGRAM, PROGRAM EQUIPMENT, SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THEREWITH ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. DIGITAL SEAT MEDIA DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO PROGRAM, PROGRAM EQUIPMENT, SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. DIGITAL SEAT MEDIA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DIGITAL SEAT MEDIA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>
<p>13.2<br/>
Exclusions. THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Digital Seat Media does not disclaim any warranty or other right that Digital Seat Media is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.</p>
<p>14.<br/>
Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>14.1<br/>
Consequential Damages. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE DIGITAL SEAT MEDIA ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY DIGITAL SEAT MEDIA ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.</p>
<p>14.2<br/>

<p>14.3<br/>
Allocation of Risk. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<p>15.<br/>
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</p>
<p>15.1<br/>
Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Digital Seat Media in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Sections 6.5 and 15.2, you and Digital Seat Media agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DIGITAL SEAT MEDIA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<p>15.2<br/>
Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 15.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
<p>15.3<br/>
Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Digital Seat Media will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800- 778-7879, or by contacting Digital Seat Media. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>15.4<br/>
Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Digital Seat Media’s address for Notice is: Digital Seat Media LLC., 916 Bryan avenue, #204, Fort Worth, TX 76104. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Digital Seat Media may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Digital Seat Media must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Digital Seat Media in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Digital Seat Media will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.</p>
<p>15.5<br/>
Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Digital Seat Media will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Tarrant County, Texas, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Digital Seat Media for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
<p>15.6<br/>
No Class Actions. YOU AND DIGITAL SEAT MEDIA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Digital Seat Media agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<p>15.7<br/>
Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Digital Seat Media makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Digital Seat Media’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Digital Seat Media’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Digital Seat Media will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>
<p>15.8<br/>
Enforceability. If Section 15.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
<p>16.<br/>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<p>16.1<br/>
Independent Contractors. You and Digital Seat Media expressly intend that you participate in the Program as an independent contractor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you are not authorized to bind Digital Seat Media to any liability or obligation or to represent that Digital Seat Media has any authority. You will indemnify and hold Digital Seat Media harmless to the extent of any obligation imposed on Digital Seat Media resulting from a determination that you are not an independent contractor.</p>
<p>16.2<br/>
Governing Law. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Digital Seat Media submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Tarrant County, Texas for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms.</p>
<p>16.3<br>
Privacy Policy. Please read the Digital Seat Media Privacy Policy available at  https://digitalseat.com/privacypolicy  carefully for information relating to our collection, use, storage, disclosure of your personal information. The Digital Seat Media Privacy Policy is incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.</p>
<p>16.4<br/>
Additional Terms. Your participation in the Program is subject to all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Program that we may post on or link to from the Service (the “Additional Terms”). All Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.</p>
<p>16.5<br/>
Third Party Services and Linked Websites. The Service may contain links to third party websites or services. Linked websites and services are not under Digital Seat Media’s control, and Digital Seat Media is not responsible for their content or performance.</p>
<p>16.6<br/>
Consent to Electronic Communications. By participating in the Program, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.</p>
<p>16.7<br/>
Contact Information. The Program is operated by Digital Seat Media LLC: 916 Bryan Avenue, #204, Fort Worth, TX 76104. You may contact us by sending correspondence to that address or by emailing us at support@digitalseat.com. You can access a copy of these Terms online at <a href="https://digitalseat.com/legalpolicy" target="_blank">https://digitalseat.com/legalpolicy</a></p>
<p>16.8<br/>
General Terms. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Digital Seat Media regarding your participation in the Program. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>
